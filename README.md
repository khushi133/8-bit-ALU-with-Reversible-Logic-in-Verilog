# 8-bit-ALU-with-Reversible-Logic-in-Verilog
An 8-bit ALU using Verilog and reversible logic, built in Vivado. Supports arithmetic (add, subtract, increment, complement) and logical (AND, OR, NOT, XOR) operations with DKG and Peres gates. COG gate used for MUX design. Includes a testbench for functional verification and optimized for low-power performance.
